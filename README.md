 ## :seedling: Introduction
  
  Pen was created as a team project for a school assignment in late 2020. The brief was to create a basic note-taking app without using any major JS framework. It listed a set of specified features, such as being able to favorite notes, simpler styling and saving notes in local storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  We decided to add a markdown editor, search function and categorization system by hashtags, as well as darkmode, customized editor toolbar and simpler statistics. Here is a live working [beta](https://penapp.netlify.app/).

## :crown: Make note-taking great again

Pen is a divine new note app. 
It uses a ground breaking tag system to categorize notes, as well as having a beautiful, elegant star icon to be able to favorite notes. 
The bold styling of titles in contrast to the lightweight content text makes Pen a sublime user experience. 

Welcome to the glorious world of Pen.
